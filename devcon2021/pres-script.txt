Alright it looks like it's time to get started, so let's do this.

Now this presentation will be a little bit different than what you may be used
to, because everything you see on this screen for the next 45 minutes, or so,
will be completely contained within a terminal emulator.

And when I say everything, I mean everything.

<title>

the command line

What you see here is probably the coolest part of this presentation, so I'll
let you enjoy it for a moment.

And that moment is now over, sorry.

Who am I?

My name is Alan Morgan. I'm a Software Engineer here at Clearwater Analytics.
I've been using Linux for about 10 years now. And I'm obsessed with the command
line.

I know what you're thinking. The command line? Come on Alan. We live in the
21st century. People use graphical user interfaces now. They're easy, they
look nice, and they're very useful.

Ok, I agree. Graphical user interfaces are easy, they do look nice, and they
are useful. But the command line is useful too. It can look nice if you want.
And it doesn't have to be hard.

My goal for this presentation is to convince you to use the command line a
little bit more than you currently do.

We'll start with the unix philosophy.
