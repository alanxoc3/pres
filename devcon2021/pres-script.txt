Alright, thanks x.

As x mentioned, I'm alan. I'm a Software Engineer here at Clearwater Analytics.
I've been using Linux for about 10 years now. And I'm obsessed with the command
line.

Now this presentation will be a little different than what you may be used to,
because everything you see on this screen will be completely contained within
a terminal emulator.

And when I say everything, I mean everything.

the command line

What you see here is probably the coolest part of the presentation, so i'll
let you soak it in for a minute while i briefly explain my setup.

the terminal emulator i'm using is called alacritty, the bottom bar you see is
from me running tmux locally on my laptop. the top bar is from me running tmux
remotely through ssh on an arch linux machine. and the powerpoint-like
presentation software i'm using is called lookatme.

i'm going to cover a lot of content in the next 40 minutes. if you feel lost,
we'll have a few questions at the end, you can rewatch this online, and i also
have a keylogger running at the bottom right of the screen so i hope that
helps.

by the end of this presentation i hope you feel motivated to use the
commandline a bit more than you currently do as part of your daily workflow.

from here i'll go over some of the history of the terminal emulator and the
command line, then you can watch me run a bunch of random commands. if we're
lucky, nothing will go wrong. so let's get started.

the terminal emulator has a pretty neat history, and it kind starts with
teleprinters. teleprinters were these typewriter like devices in the early
1900s that were connected to the telegraph system. as you type a message, it
prints your message to paper as well as sends the message over the telegraph
wire. another teleprinter receives that message and prints it to their piece of
paper character by character.

computers then came along in the 1950s, operating by a punch card system. once
computers started implementing time sharing in the 1960s, using teleprinters to
interact with computers started to become more popular.

computer terminals then came along in the 1970s with a bunch of nice features
over teleprinters including, not too being loud, displaying characters
instantly, being able to modify characters anywhere on a screen, and of course
making the world greener by using less paper.

finally in our world of 4k monitors, we run programs called "terminal
emulators" to imitate these earlier "computer terminals". windows, mac, and
linux all have default terminal emulators. kitty, terminator, alacritty, and
xterm are a few of the many others.

the history of the commandline is really just the history of the unix operating
system. the story of unix takes place in the 1960s and 70s with a group of
researchers at bell labs who were working on an operating system called
multics. they became frustrated with the complexity of multics, so they
abandoned that project to work on something smaller, which later became unix.
unix began to be distributed to universities throughout the 70s and 80s. macos
and linux were later built off unix in the 90s. and the rest is history.

one of the reasons unix and the commandline have been so successful is because
of the unix philosophy. There are many definitions of the "Unix Philosophy",
the one i like most is attributed to Douglas McIlroy he was the creator of the
unix pipe and one of those researchers at bell labs in the 60s and 70s. he
said,

"this is the unix philosophy: write programs that do one thing and do it well.
write programs to work together. write programs to handle text streams, because
that is a universal interface."
