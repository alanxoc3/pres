# philosophy more?
in school, i was told to never 
couldn't tell you who said never do this, but i do remember hearing that.
it's like saying you can't depend on a webservice, because it's not in the same internet as your webservice.

```cpp
// g++ -x c++ -
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::system("echo üëãüåç");
    return 0;
}
```

# more topics that i won't get into
- docker, hugo, nmap, socat, group management, ...
- don't be afraid to look in random directories on your computer. you might learn something.
- must have: fzf! show example usage for fzf.
- pass, fzf, fd, rg, ranger, diff-so-fancy, nvim, kak, w3m, lynx, irssi, lam, asciinema
