# terminal emulator history
- telegraph: morse code, baudot code
- typewriters: sholes & glidden
- teleprinter: teletype model 33, creed model 7
- computer terminals: datapoint 3300, ibm 2250, vt100, adm-3a
- terminal emulators: kitty, terminator, alacritty, xterm

# command line history
- 1964: work on multics begins
- 1969: work on unix begins
- 1975: unix is distributed outside bell labs
- 1991: work on linux begins
- 1999: mac os is now unix based

> this is the unix philosophy: write programs that do one thing and do it well.
> write programs to work together. write programs to handle text streams, because

# the shell

# multiplexing
similar to gui-based tiling window managers (bspwm, i3, awesome, sway, amethyst, yabai).

- screen: terminal multiplexer
- tmux: newer terminal multiplexer

other multiplexers/frameworks: byobu, zelij

# basic navigation
- pwd: print working directory
- cd: change working directory
- ls: list directory contents
- find: search for files in a directory

# file manipulation
- mkdir: create a directory
- touch: change file timestamps
- cp: copy files
- mv: rename/move files
- rm: remove files
- rmdir: remove a directory

# files & executables
- cat: concatenate files to standard output
- file: determine file type
- g++: c compiler
- chmod: change file access permissions
- which: locate program in path

# env variables
- echo: print something
- $USER: current user
- $PWD: current working directory
- $HOME: current user's home directory
- $PATH: directories where to look for executables

# the unix pipe
- `>`: redirect stdout to a file
- `|`: redirect stdout to stdin for another command
- head: output the first part of a text stream
- tail: output the last part of a text stream
- less: interface to view long output
- wc: print newline, word, and byte counts for text

# unix pipe exercise
try to print the word that is most common in a file:

```sh
cat LICENSE | ...
```

# unix pipe solution
here is one solution to print the most common word in a file:

```sh
cat LICENSE
| tr ' ' '\n'
| sed -E 's/\W//g'
| awk '/.+/ {print tolower($0);}'
| sort
| uniq -c
| sort -n
| tail -n 1
| awk '{print $2;}'
```

# cli editors
- ed: line oriented text editor
- ex & vi: full screen text editor
- vim: vi improved
- nano: easy to use editor
- emacs: a very extensible editor

# modern editors
- nvim: modern version of vim
- kak: a spinoff of vim
- spacemacs & doom emacs: vim friendly extensions to emacs

# documentation
- dotfiles: a place to manage your configuration & notes
- alias: create an alias of a complex command
- `--help`: common option on commands
- man: format and display manual pages
- info: read info documents
- tldr: documentation before a man page

# modern tooling upgrades
- rg: grep clone but faster
- fd: find clone with better interface
- exa: ls clone with knowledge of git
- bat: cat clone with syntax hilighting

# TODO: fuzzy finding
- fzf: commandline fuzzy finder

fuzzy find all tldr tldr help snippets
```sh
tldr -l | tr "'" '"' | jq .[] -r | fzf | xargs tldr
```

fuzzy find all executables in your path
```sh
echo $PATH | tr : ' ' | xargs fd . --exact-depth 1 2>/dev/null | fzf
```
