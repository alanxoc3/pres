douglas mcilroy was one of the creators of unix.

internal details don't matter when using pipes.

#
word processing system for secretaries to type. but you need your

text processing was a theme through the life of unix.

# history of terminal emulators
- teleprinter/teletype: teletype model 33, creed model 7
- computer terminals: datapoint 3300, ibm 2250, vt100, adm-3a
- terminal emulators: xterm, kitty, alacritty, windows/mac terminal

```end-script
./pres teletype
```

# the shell
- v6: shell on version 6 of unix
- sh: bourne shell
- bash: gnu bourne-again shell
- zsh: the friendly interactive shell
- fish: the z shell
- nu: a new type of shell

# basic navigation
- pwd: print working directory
- cd: change working directory
- ls: list directory contents
- find: search for files in a directory

# file manipulation
- touch: change file timestamps
- cp: copy files
- mv: move/rename files
- rm: remove files

# the unix pipe
- echo: display text
- yes: output a string repeatedly until killed
- cat: concatenate files to standard output
- head: output the first part of a text stream
- tail: output the last part of a text stream
- `|`, `>`, `>>`, `<`, `<<`, `2>`, `&>`...

# filtering
- grep: print lines that match patterns
- sort: sort lines of text
- uniq: print or omit duplicated lines
- wc: print newline, word, and byte counts for text

wc is not to be confused with "water closet".

```
(echo hi && yes hello) | head -n 100 | uniq -c | awk '{print $1 " " $2}'
```

# documentation
- man: format and display manual pages
- info: read info documents
- tldr: display simple help pages for command line tools

# multiplexing
- screen: terminal multiplexer
- tmux: newer terminal multiplexer
- zellij: rust based terminal workspace

similar to gui window managers (bspwm, i3, awesome, sway, amethyst, yabai).

# blah
tldr -l | tr "'" '"' | jq .[] -r | fzf | xargs tldr




- shell: sh, bash
- navigation: cd, ls, pwd, find
- management: rm, mv, cp
- viewing: cat, head, tail, less
- filtering: grep

# unix command line improvements
- shell: zsh, fish, nu
- navigation: exa, fd
- management: rsync
- viewing: bat
- filtering: rg, fzf

# history of cli editors
- early editors: ed, ex, vi
- later editors: vim, nano, emacs
- newer editors: neovim, spacemacs, doom emacs, kakoune, helix...

# a simplified unix philosophy
write programs that:
- do one thing well
- handle text streams

programs tend to work well with each other if they have only one focus and
handle text streams.




# programs that do one thing well
monolithic architecture vs microservice architecture
why write programs that do one thing well?
- simplicity

# commandline and webservices
unix philosophy is like a microservice architecture. theoretically, the entire
system is composed of simple pieces that work together to achieve something
complex.

# analogies
# do one thing well. like online payment systems to paypal.
# or like other things.
# a brief introduction of the commandline
# managing complexity (man page, tldr...)
# dotfiles
# history of the commandline

# ---
i want to do something on the commandline. what should i do first?
# ---

how about some real world examples?

there
 be many small and simple pieces that work together to make a system
work.

some decent examples
- mv, rm, cat, tee
- cp -> rsync
- ls -> exa

# programs that do one thing well
what can "Finder" or "Windows Explorer" do?

# programs that work well with other programs
# programs that work well with humans

# browsing the file system
- cd, ls, pwd, exit, cat
- ranger
- locate, updatedb, grep
- rg, fzf, fd, exa

# env vars, shell functions, aliases

# navigating git
- git, diff-so-fancy

# shell built-ins vs utilities
- builtins: exit, cd, 

# important programs in my workflow
- fzf: fuzzy find
- rg: ripgrep

# browsing the web
- gemini/gopher
- w3m, lynx, browsh

# social
- irssi - irc
- himalaya/mutt - email

# what is posix and why should i care?
posix is a standard. we can't have a powerful commandline if no one followed any standard whatsoever. there would be too many incompatible implementations if that was the case.

in school, i was told to never 
couldn't tell you who said never do this, but i do remember hearing that.
it's like saying you can't depend on a webservice, because it's not in the same internet as your webservice.
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::system("echo üëãüåç");
    return 0;
}
```

# ideas
- don't be afraid to look in random directories on your computer. you might learn something.
- must have: fzf! show example usage for fzf.
