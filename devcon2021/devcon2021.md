# a simplified unix philosophy
write programs that:
- do one thing well
- handle text streams

programs tend to work well with each other if they have only one focus and
handle text streams.

# programs that do one thing well
monolithic architecture vs microservice architecture
why write programs that do one thing well?
- simplicity

# commandline and webservices
unix philosophy is like a microservice architecture. theoretically, the entire
system is composed of simple pieces that work together to achieve something
complex.

# analogies
# do one thing well. like online payment systems to paypal.
# or like other things.
# a brief introduction of the commandline
# managing complexity (man page, tldr...)
# dotfiles
# history of the commandline

i want to do something on the commandline. what should i do first?
# ---

how about some real world examples?

there
 be many small and simple pieces that work together to make a system
work.

some decent examples
- mv, rm, cat, tee
- cp -> rsync
- ls -> exa

# programs that do one thing well
what can "Finder" or "Windows Explorer" do?

# programs that work well with other programs
# programs that work well with humans

# browsing the file system
- cd, ls, pwd, exit, cat
- ranger
- locate, updatedb, grep
- rg, fzf, fd, exa

# history of cli editors
- ed, em, en, ex, vi: early unix editors some written for teleprinters
- vim, neovim, emacs, kakoune, nano: modern editors

# env vars, shell functions, aliases

# navigating git
- git, diff-so-fancy

# shell built-ins vs utilities
- builtins: exit, cd, 

# important programs in my workflow
- fzf: fuzzy find
- rg: ripgrep

# browsing the web
- gemini/gopher
- w3m, lynx, browsh

# social
- irssi - irc
- himalaya/mutt - email

# what is posix and why should i care?
posix is a standard. we can't have a powerful commandline if no one followed any standard whatsoever. there would be too many incompatible implementations if that was the case.

what is posi

in school, i was told to never 
couldn't tell you who said never do this, but i do remember hearing that.
it's like saying you can't depend on a webservice, because it's not in the same internet as your webservice.
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::system("echo üëãüåç");
    return 0;
}
```

# ideas
- don't be afraid to look in random directories on your computer. you might learn something.
- must have: fzf! show example usage for fzf.
